Turns out, adulthood isn’t like what I imagined. When I was younger, even just a year ago, I thought being an adult with a stable job and a good salary was the ultimate goal in life. I worked hard to get into a prestigious school and university, landed internships at reputable companies, and did everything for one purpose: to get a job that paid well. That was what kept me going for years.

But now, after finally getting my dream job (even just five days after my thesis defense), it doesn’t feel the way I thought it would. Somehow it feels boring, lonely, and confusing, even when I’m becoming the person I once dreamed of being. I have a routine that looks ideal on paper, the kind of life I used to picture for myself, yet something feels off. Maybe it’s because, for the first time, I don’t know what comes next. Maybe it’s because the one goal I’ve been chasing all my life isn’t everything, and now that I’ve reached it, it feels strangely empty. Or maybe because I’m learning that reaching the destination is only another beginning, not the end I imagined.

For as long as I can remember, there was always something to chase. In high school, it was getting into a good university. In college, it was maintaining my GPA, finding internships, and securing a job. Everyone was doing that. Every stage of my life seemed to have a direction, a clear purpose that kept me moving forward. But now that I’m finally here, I’m not sure what I’m supposed to aim for. I have the time, the stability, and the calm I once longed for, yet I feel oddly hollow. I have the freedom I wanted, but it feels like I’ve lost the momentum that once made life exciting.

Friends my age are also walking such different paths, and that makes me wonder if I’ve chosen the right one. Should I keep climbing the corporate ladder and stay loyal to one company? Or should I start something on my own, build something from scratch? Should I pursue another degree because somehow I miss studying and taking exams? Or maybe, for the first time ever, should I focus on my personal life, on building a serious relationship, on finding emotional stability instead of professional success? I don’t know, and that uncertainty quietly scares me.

Another thing I’ve learned after entering adulthood is that I crave companionship more than I ever expected. I used to think I was good at being alone. Maybe I even romanticized it a little. The quiet, the independence, the idea of being strong and self-sufficient. But I’ve realized I only enjoy solitude when life feels hard, when I'm in the middle of working hard to pursue something and when my mind is crowded. Yeah, that’s the avoidant part of me. But when things are calm, when I finally have peace, when the chaos subsides, I feel lonely. I think too much. And also start craving connection. I want spontaneous plans, a companionship and people who make ordinary days feel less dull. Because this routine, the life that I'm living right now sometimes feels empty.

But don’t get me wrong, I’m deeply grateful for what I have. My work-life balance is good, my team is supportive, and my life is stable. It’s everything I once wanted. Yet somehow, I feel restless. Maybe it’s because I’m no longer chasing anything. For years, I was driven by goals, medals, grades, and recognition. Now that I finally have time and a good work life balance, it feels like I’ve lost the spark that once made life exciting.

Maybe this is what growing up feels like. The quiet confusion between gratitude and longing. Learning to live with uncertainty, to find meaning in stillness, and to build a life that isn’t always about progress, but about to be grateful.
